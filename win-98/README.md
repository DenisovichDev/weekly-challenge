# Windows 95 Minesweeper Thingie

Okay, this one was a bit painful.

## Instructions

There are hidden easter eggs on the page, try to find it.

## Details

The minesweeper window you see is the p5.js canvas. Everything else is just mostly CSS. That language without any comments, remember? ðŸ˜œ

I have made a [p5 editor version](https://editor.p5js.org/DenisovichDev/sketches/GyP-bPJTG) of the game for you to deconstruct. Rest of it, I don't think you need to bother.
