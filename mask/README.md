# Pure CSS Mask

This is a Guy Fawkes inspired mask written in CSS, and just a tiny bit of JS, which is not really required, to be honest with you.  
When I say it's written in CSS what I mean is it's written in SCSS, and compiled CSS. I don't really care, it's still CSS, and I would argue that it was equally painful to code.
